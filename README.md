Hi, my name is Altug and I am a junior front-end developer with a passion for building modern, interactive web applications using the latest technologies.
I am particularly interested in working on Web3 projects, as I believe this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet and create decentralized, secure applications.

In my previous experiences, I have gained skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks such as React. ðŸ’» Currently, I am also learning Solidity, the programming language used to build smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, as I believe it is an important skill to have in the world of Web3 development. ðŸ“ˆ

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to contribute my skills and ideas to Web3 projects. ðŸš€
